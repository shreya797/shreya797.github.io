                                        <h1> Sharks have ruled the oceans for more than 400 million years and the removal of such large numbers from the ecosystem can have irreversible effects on every species in the marine web, including popular seafood such as shellfish. Since sharks are top predators, their decimation creates a ripple effect throughout the marine food web, impairing the balance of the ocean ecosystem. Sharks are particularly vulnerable, because they produce few young and reach sexual maturity late in life.There is a global misconception that the oceans are teeming with sharks. Existing population data shows that some shark populations have declined by as much as 99 percent. Many shark species are being overfished at rates and with methods that are highly unsustainable and, as a result, are now facing extinction.</h1>
